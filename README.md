The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column, or a
diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. The program prompts two players to drop a red
or yellow disk alternately. In the preceding figure, the red disk is shown in a dark color and the
yellow in a light color. Whenever a disk is dropped, the program redisplays the board on the
console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue). Here is a sample run
